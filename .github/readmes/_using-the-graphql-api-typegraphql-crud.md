## Using the GraphQL API

`typegraphql-prisma` emits the generated TypeGraphQL classes to `node_modules/@generated/typegraphql-prisma` whenever `npx prisma generate` is invoked.

It also generates a number of model classes, enums as well CRUD and relation resolver based on your `schema.prisma` file. The generated CRUD resolvers match the operations of the [Prisma Client API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference):

- `create`
- `update`
- `delete`
- `findUnique`
- `findFirst`
- `findMany`
- `updateMany`
- `deleteMany`
- `upsert`
- `aggregate`
- `groupBy`

Below are example operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground. You can explore other operations in the **Docs** section of the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

#### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create a new user

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Sarah",
    email: "sarah@prisma.io"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Create a new draft

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    data: {
      title: "Join the Prisma Discord",
      content: "https://pris.ly/discord"
      author: {
        connect: {
          email: "alice@prisma.io"
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

#### Publish an existing draft

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(data: { published: { set: true } }, where: { id: __POST_ID__ }){
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  posts(
    where: {
      OR: { content: { contains: "graphql" }, title: { contains: "graphql" } }
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Retrieve a single post

```graphql
{
  post(where: { id: __POST_ID__ }) {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Delete a post

```graphql
mutation{
  deletePost(where:{id: __POST_ID__}){
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.
