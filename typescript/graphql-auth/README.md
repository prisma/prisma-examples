# GraphQL Server with Authentication & Permissions

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with an email-password-based authentication workflow and authentication rules**, based on Prisma, [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga), [graphql-shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield) & [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone the `prisma2` branch of this repository:

```
git clone --single-branch --branch prisma2 git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git
```

Install Node dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/graphql-auth
npm install
```

### 2. Install the Prisma 2 CLI

To run the example, you need the [Prisma 2 CLI](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-2-cli.md):

```
npm install -g prisma2
```

### 3. Set up database

For this example, you'll use a simple [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). To set up your database, run:

```
prisma2 lift save --name 'init'
prisma2 lift up
```

You can now use the [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to view and edit your data in the `./prisma/dev.db` file that was created when you ran `prisma2 lift up`.

<Summary><b>Alternative: </b>Connect to your own database</Summary>

Prisma supports MySQL and PostgreSQL at the moment. If you would like to connect to your own database, you can do so by specifying a different data source in the [Prisma schema file](prisma/schema.prisma).

For a MySQL provider:
```
datasource mysql {
    provider = "mysql"
    url      = "mysql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:3306/mydatabase"
}
```

*OR*

For a PostgreSQL provider:
```
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public"
}
```

> Note: In the above example connection strings, `johndoe` would be the username to your database, `secret42` the password, `mydatabase` the name of your database, and `public` the [PostgreSQL schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/ddl-schemas.html). 

Then to migrate your database, run:

```sh
prisma2 lift save --name 'init'
prisma2 lift up
```
</Details>

### 4. Generate Photon (type-safe database client)

Run the following command to generate [Photon.js](https://photonjs.prisma.io/):

```
prisma2 generate
```

Now you can seed your database using the `seed` script from `package.json`:

```
npm run seed
```


### 5. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

### 6. Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./src/schema.graphql`](./src/schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

#### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Register a new user

You can send the following mutation in the Playground to sign up a new user and retrieve an authentication token for them:

```graphql
mutation {
  signup(name: "Sarah", email: "sarah@prisma.io", password: "graphql") {
    token
  }
}
```

#### Log in an existing user

This mutation will log in an existing user by requesting a new authentication token for them:

```graphql
mutation {
  login(email: "sarah@prisma.io", password: "graphql") {
    token
  }
}
```

#### Check whether a user is currently logged in with the `me` query

For this query, you need to make sure a valid authentication token is sent along with the `Bearer`-prefix in the `Authorization` header of the request:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer __YOUR_TOKEN__"
}
```

With a real token, this looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJjanAydHJyczFmczE1MGEwM3kxaWl6c285IiwiaWF0IjoxNTQzNTA5NjY1fQ.Vx6ad6DuXA0FSQVyaIngOHYVzjKwbwq45flQslnqX04"
}
```

Inside the Playground, you can set HTTP headers in the bottom-left corner:

Once you've set the header, you can send the following query to check whether the token is valid:

```graphql
{
  me {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

#### Create a new draft

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground.

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
    content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

#### Publish an existing draft

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. The authentication token must belong to the user who created the post.

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Search for posts with a specific title or content

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. 

```graphql
{
  filterPosts(searchString: "graphql") {
    id
    title
    content
    published 
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Retrieve a single post

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. 

```graphql
{
  post(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Delete a post

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. The authentication token must belong to the user who created the post.

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

### 6. Changing the GraphQL schema

To make changes to the GraphQL schema, you need to manipulate the [`Query`](./src/resolvers/Query.ts) and [`Mutation`](./src/resolvers/Mutation.ts) types. 

Note that the [`start`](./package.json#L6) script also starts a development server that automatically updates your schema every time you save a file. This way, the auto-generated [GraphQL schema](./src/generated/schema.graphql) updates whenever you make changes in to the `Query` or `Mutation` types inside your TypeScript code.
