## Do more, manage less

Reduce app development and operation costs and realize more plans.

Skeet is an open-source full-stack app development solution.
You can start writing app logic immediately without worrying about infrastructure.

### High Performance

Distributed systems leveraging various event triggers such as Auth and storage work more efficiently, and Firestore, a NoSQL database, scales flexibly and supports realtime stream.

### Eco-friendly

Computing resources automatically scale to match your usage patterns, so you always have as much as you need. Skeet is designed to be economically and environmentally friendly.

### Developer Experience

You can start writing app logic immediately without worrying about deploying or maintaining server infrastructure. TypeScript support makes apps more secure and improves development efficiency.

### Security built-in

In addition to SSL support, DDoS attacks and bot countermeasures using Cloud Armor, minimal endpoint exposure, and Pub/Sub messaging can be easily applied to achieve Google-scale security.

## A new-age app development platform

Everything you need to develop and publish your app. The Skeet framework tools are designed to make handling serverless architectures, which tend to be distributed and complicated, as easy as possible.

### High performance monitor

Firebase Emulator Suite makes your backend visible. The development speed will increase since you can centrally manage databases, storage, and all logs from authentication information.

### Powerful CLI Tool

Skeet CLI completes constructing a distributed system that combines Google Cloud's serverless products with a single command. Just answer a few simple questions, and your app is ready to deploy.

### Zero-maintenance

Automatic deployment with GitHub Actions and deployed resources automatically scale as needed, eliminating the need for server infrastructure maintenance.

## Experience new app development

Experience new app development.
You can immediately develop and publish web, iOS, and Android apps.

In the Skeet tutorial, we will develop an AI chatbot app using the OpenAI API and confirm that it can be deployed and used.
