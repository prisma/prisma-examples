## Reduce app development and maintenance costs

Many points can be improved through application development in our lives and society.

However, to create and publish an application, a wide range of knowledge and skills, from server infrastructure to applications, is required, so many teams currently need help.

It is always challenging to achieve both rapid development and maintainability. On top of that, it is necessary to solve complex problems during scale-up, so it takes a lot of time to obtain a reproducible development environment.

Since the cost of maintaining an app that has been successfully released is steadily increasing, the development site must take on the challenge of adding and improving functions while maintaining the status quo is difficult.

As the importance of apps increases in our lives and society, the shortage of IT resources is still accelerating, and development resources need to be increased at almost all sites.

We want to address this issue by lowering application development and maintenance costs.

Skeet allows you to get your app up and running quickly and maintain it for the long term at a low cost.

## Serverless architecture powered by Firebase

Firebase is an app development platform that helps you build and scale the apps and games your users love. It is a service highly trusted by many companies worldwide, supported by Google's infrastructure.

Firebase provides reliable products and solutions for the entire app lifecycle. Everyone can use Firebase products to solve complex problems and optimize your app's experience. Firebase is powered by Google Cloud and lets you scale your apps to billions of users.

Use cases are not limited to application development but also include API servers, scheduled task execution, function execution by event handlers, stream data pipelines, etc., and can be used in a wide range of applications, from new projects to partial applications to existing projects.

## Develop and manage eco-friendly, high-performance distributed systems at low cost

You can combine Firebase products to build an eco-friendly, high-performance distributed system. It utilizes server resources only as needed, allowing for a very environmentally and economically friendly design.

The design and material costs of "predicting access loads in advance (design costs) and increasing server resources (material costs)" are no longer necessary, and concentrating more on things and developing is possible.

Furthermore, maintenance costs are significantly reduced. Post-release apps also automatically scale up computing resources to match user usage patterns. You don't need to worry about credentials, configuration, provisioning new servers, or decommissioning old servers.

Skeet is an open-source, full-stack serverless app development solution that makes Firebase and Google Cloud product combinations easier and easier to use.

Skeet CLI is not only for setting, deploying, and managing Firebase products but also for application development, such as VPN network settings, domain and name server settings, load balancer management security settings using Cloud Armor, and CI & CD using GitHub Actions. We provide that with a single command. Skeet supports everything from backend construction to front-end web, iOS, and Android development.

In addition, for more scalable and robust application development, we adopt tools useful for development, such as TypeScript, Jest, ESLint & Prettier by default. TypeScript is mainly used for ease of application creation, but it is also possible to build applications that partially utilize machine learning using Python.

By using Skeet, you can significantly reduce app development and maintenance costs and realize more plans.
