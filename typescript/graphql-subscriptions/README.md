# Subscriptions Apollo Server + Nexus

This example shows how to implement **GraphQL subscriptions in TypeScript** with the following stack:

- [**Apollo Server**](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server): HTTP server for GraphQL APIs   
- [**GraphQL Nexus**](https://nexusjs.org/docs/): GraphQL schema definition and resolver implementation 
- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client): Databases access (ORM)                  
- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Database migrations               
- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): Local, file-based SQL database

Note that **Apollo Server** includes the `PubSub` realtime component from the [`graphql-subscriptions`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions) package that's needed to implement GraphQL subscriptions.

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies

Download this example:

```
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-examples-latest/typescript/graphql-subscriptions
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd graphql-subscriptions
npm install
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/graphql-subscriptions
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.


### 3. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

## Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./schema.graphql`](./schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

### Subscribe to new posts being created

Subscriptions work a bit differently in GraphQL Playgrounds compared to queries and mutations. Queries and mutations immediately show the result on the right side of the Playground â€“ subscription results on the other hand will only be shown once a subscription is triggered. Here is an example for the `newPost` subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  newPost {
    id
    title
    published
    author {
      id
      email
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Once you submit this subscription, the GraphQL Playground will enter a "waiting" state:

As soon as the subscription is [triggered](./src/schema.ts#l117) (via the`createDraft` mutation), the right side of the GraphQL Playground data will show the data of the newly created draft.

### Create a new draft

To properly observe the subscription result, it's best to open two GraphQL Playground windows side-by-side and run the mutation in the second one. However, you _can_ also just run the subscription and mutation in different tabs, only in this case you won't be able to see the subscription data pop up in "realtime" (since you only see it when you navigate back to the tab with the "waiting" subscription). 

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    data: { title: "Join the Prisma Slack", content: "https://slack.prisma.io" }
    authorEmail: "alice@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Here's what it looks like when switching tabs:

### Subscribe to the publishing of drafts

```graphql
subscription {
  postPublished {
    id
    title
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Publish/unpublish an existing post

```graphql
mutation {
  togglePublishPost(id: __POST_ID__) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

Note that you need to replace the `__POST_ID__` placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` record in the database, e.g.`5`:

```graphql
mutation {
  togglePublishPost(id: 5) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

The subscription will only be fired if the `published` field is updated from `false` to `true`, but not the other way around. This logic is implemented in the resolver of the `togglePublishPost` mutation [here](./src/schema.ts#l135).

## Switch to another database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than SQLite, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block. 

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local PostgreSQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/notesapi?schema=public"
}
```

### MySQL

For MySQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local MySQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/notesapi"
}
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

Here is an example connection string with a local Microsoft SQL Server database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = "sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
}
```

### MongoDB

Here is an example connection string with a local MongoDB database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = "mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}
```
Because MongoDB is currently in [Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/releases#preview), you need to specify the `previewFeatures` on your `generator` block:

```
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["mongodb"]
}
```
