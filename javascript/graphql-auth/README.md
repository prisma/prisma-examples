## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies

Download this example:

```
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-examples-latest/javascript/graphql-auth
```

Install npm dependencies:
```
cd graphql-auth
npm install
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/javascript/graphql-auth
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Now, seed the database with the sample data in [`prisma/seed.js`](./prisma/seed.js) by running the following command:

```
npx prisma db seed 
```


### 3. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

## Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./schema.graphql`](./schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

<details><summary><strong>See more API operations</strong></summary>


### Register a new user

You can send the following mutation in the Playground to sign up a new user and retrieve an authentication token for them:

```graphql
mutation {
  signup(name: "Sarah", email: "sarah@prisma.io", password: "HelloWorld42") {
    token
  }
}
```

### Log in an existing user

This mutation will log in an existing user by requesting a new authentication token for them.

```graphql
mutation {
  login(email: "sarah@prisma.io", password: "HelloWorld42") {
    token
  }
}
```

If you seeded the database with sample data in step 2. of this README, you can use the following `email` and `password` combinations (from [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts)) for the `login` mutation as well:

| Email               | Password         |
| :------------------ | :--------------- |
| `alice@prisma.io`   | `myPassword42`   |
| `nilu@prisma.io`    | `random42`       |
| `mahmoud@prisma.io` | `iLikeTurtles42` |

### Check whether a user is currently logged in with the `me` query

For this query, you need to make sure a valid authentication token is sent along with the `Bearer`-prefix in the `Authorization` header of the request:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer __YOUR_TOKEN__"
}
```

With a real token, this looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJjanAydHJyczFmczE1MGEwM3kxaWl6c285IiwiaWF0IjoxNTQzNTA5NjY1fQ.Vx6ad6DuXA0FSQVyaIngOHYVzjKwbwq45flQslnqX04"
}
```

Inside the Playground, you can set HTTP headers in the bottom-left corner:

![](https://imgur.com/ToRcCTj.png)

Once you've set the header, you can send the following query to check whether the token is valid:

```graphql
{
  me {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Create a new draft

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground.

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    data: {
      title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
      content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
    }
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

### Publish an existing post

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. The authentication token must belong to the user who created the post.

```graphql
mutation {
  togglePublishPost(id: __POST_ID__) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

Note that you need to replace the `__POST_ID__` placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` record in the database, e.g.`5`:

```graphql
mutation {
  togglePublishPost(id: 5) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  feed(
    searchString: "prisma"
  ) {
    id
    title
    content
    published
  }
}
```

### Retrieve a single post

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground.

```graphql
{
  postById(id: __POST_ID__ ) {
    id
    title
    content
    published
  }
}
```

Note that you need to replace the `__POST_ID__` placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` record in the database, e.g.`5`:

```graphql
{
  postById(id: 5 ) {
    id
    title
    content
    published
  }
}
```


### Delete a post

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. The authentication token must belong to the user who created the post.

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(id: __POST_ID__) {
    id
  }
}
```

Note that you need to replace the `__POST_ID__` placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` record in the database, e.g.`5`:

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(id: 5) {
    id
  }
}
```

### Retrieve the drafts of a user

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. 

```graphql
{
  draftsByUser(
    userUniqueInput: {
      email: "mahmoud@prisma.io"
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

</details>


### Authenticating GraphQL requests

In this example, you authenticate your GraphQL requests using the `Authorization` header field of the HTTP requests which are sent from clients to your GraphQL server. The required authentication token is returned by successful `signup` and `login` mutations.

Using the GraphQL Playground, the `Authorization` header can be configured in the **HTTP HEADERS** tab in the bottom-left corner of the GraphQL Playground. The values for the HTTP headers are defined in JSON format. Note that the authentication token needs to be sent with the `Bearer `-prefix:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer __YOUR_TOKEN__"
}
```

With a "real" authentication token, it looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJjanAydHJyczFmczE1MGEwM3kxaWl6c285IiwiaWF0IjoxNTQzNTA5NjY1fQ.Vx6ad6DuXA0FSQVyaIngOHYVzjKwbwq45flQslnqX04"
}
```

As mentioned before, you can set HTTP headers in the bottom-left corner of the GraphQL Playground:

### Authorization rules

The following [authorization rules](./src/permissions/index.ts) are defined for the GraphQL API via GraphQL Shield:

| Operation name           | Operation type | Rule                  | Description                                                                              |
| :----------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `me`                     | Query          | `isAuthenticatedUser` | Requires a user to be authenticated                                                      |
| `draftsByUser`           | Query          | `isAuthenticatedUser` | Requires a user to be authenticated                                                      |
| `postById`               | Query          | `isAuthenticatedUser` | Requires a user to be authenticated                                                      |
| `createDraft`            | Mutation       | `isAuthenticatedUser` | Requires a user to be authenticated                                                      |
| `deletePost`             | Mutation       | `isPostOwner`         | Requires the authenticated user to be the author of the post to be deleted               |
| `incrementPostViewCount` | Mutation       | `isAuthenticatedUser` | Requires a user to be authenticated                                                      |
| `togglePublishPost`      | Mutation       | `isPostOwner`         | Requires the authenticated user to be the author of the post to be published/unpublished |

The `isAuthenticatedUser` rule requires you to send a valid authentication token. The `isPostOwner` rule additionaly requires the user to whom this authentication token belongs to be the author of the post on which the operation is applied.


## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires two steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update your application code

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

The first step is to add a new table, e.g. called `Profile`, to the database. You can do this by adding a new model to your [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) file and then running a migration afterwards:

```diff
// ./prisma/schema.prisma

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name    String?
  email   String   @unique
  posts   Post[]
+ profile Profile?
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  viewCount Int      @default(0)
  author    User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

+model Profile {
+  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
+  bio    String?
+  user   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
+  userId Int     @unique
+}
```

Once you've updated your data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-profile
```

This adds another migration to the `prisma/migrations` directory and creates the new `Profile` table in the database.

### 2. Update your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the new `Profile` table. Those operations can be used to implement queries and mutations in the GraphQL API.

#### 2.1. Add the `Profile` type to your GraphQL schema

First, add a new GraphQL type via Nexus' `objectType` function:

```diff
// ./src/schema.js

+const Profile = objectType({
+  name: 'Profile',
+  definition(t) {
+    t.nonNull.int('id')
+    t.string('bio')
+    t.field('user', {
+      type: 'User',
+      resolve: (parent, _, context) => {
+        return context.prisma.profile
+          .findUnique({
+            where: { id: parent.id || undefined },
+          })
+          .user()
+      },
+    })
+  },
+})

const User = objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.nonNull.int('id')
    t.string('name')
    t.nonNull.string('email')
    t.nonNull.list.nonNull.field('posts', {
      type: 'Post',
      resolve: (parent, _, context) => {
        return context.prisma.user
          .findUnique({
            where: { id: parent.id || undefined },
          })
          .posts()
      },
+   t.field('profile', {
+     type: 'Profile',
+     resolve: (parent, _, context) => {
+       return context.prisma.user.findUnique({
+         where: { id: parent.id }
+       }).profile()
+     }
+   })
  },
})
```

Don't forget to include the new type in the `types` array that's passed to `makeSchema`:

```diff
export const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [
    Query,
    Mutation,
    Post,
    User,
+   Profile,
    UserUniqueInput,
    UserCreateInput,
    PostCreateInput,
    PostOrderBy,
    DateTime,
  ],
  // ... as before
}
```

Note that in order to resolve any type errors, your development server needs to be running so that the Nexus types can be generated. If it's not running, you can start it with `npm run dev`.

#### 2.2. Add a `createProfile` GraphQL mutation

```diff
// ./src/schema.js

const Mutation = objectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  definition(t) {

    // other mutations

+   t.field('addProfileForUser', {
+     type: 'Profile',
+     args: {
+       userUniqueInput: nonNull(
+         arg({
+           type: 'UserUniqueInput',
+         }),
+       ),
+       bio: stringArg()
+     }, 
+     resolve: async (_, args, context) => {
+       return context.prisma.profile.create({
+         data: {
+           bio: args.bio,
+           user: {
+             connect: {
+               id: args.userUniqueInput.id || undefined,
+               email: args.userUniqueInput.email || undefined,
+             }
+           }
+         }
+       })
+     }
+   })

  }
})
```

Finally, you can test the new mutation like this:

```graphql
mutation {
  addProfileForUser(
    userUniqueInput: {
      email: "mahmoud@prisma.io"
    }
    bio: "I like turtles"
  ) {
    id
    bio
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Here are some more sample Prisma Client queries on the new <code>Profile</code> model:

##### Create a new profile for an existing user

```ts
const profile = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: 'Hello World',
    user: {
      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
    },
  },
})
```

##### Create a new user with a new profile

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'john@prisma.io',
    name: 'John',
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: 'Hello World',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

##### Update the profile of an existing user

```ts
const userWithUpdatedProfile = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: {
        bio: 'Hello Friends',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</details>

## Switch to another database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than SQLite, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block. 

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local PostgreSQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/notesapi?schema=public"
}
```

### MySQL

For MySQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local MySQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/notesapi"
}
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

Here is an example connection string with a local Microsoft SQL Server database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = "sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
}
```

### MongoDB

Here is an example connection string with a local MongoDB database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = "mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}
```
Because MongoDB is currently in [Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/releases#preview), you need to specify the `previewFeatures` on your `generator` block:

```
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["mongodb"]
}
```
