# Experimental

Ths directory contains the same examples as the top-level `javascript` and `typescript` directories. The main difference is that it uses **Prisma Migrate** to perform database migrations. **Prisma Migrate is currently in an experimental state.**

⚠️ The examples in this folder have not been updated yet to the latest [`preview020`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/releases/tag/2.0.0-preview020) release and therefore are currently broken. This will be fixed soon.
