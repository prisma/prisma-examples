# REST API Example with Hono & Prisma Postgres

This example shows how to implement a **REST API with TypeScript** using [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client). It uses a [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) database.

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and navigate into the project directory

Download this example:

```
npx try-prisma@latest --template orm/hono --install npm --name hono
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```
cd hono
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/orm/hono
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Create a new [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/overview) database by executing:

```terminal
npx prisma init --db
```

If you don't have a [Prisma Data Platform](https://console.prisma.io/) account yet, or if you are not logged in, the command will prompt you to log in using one of the available authentication providers. A browser window will open so you can log in or create an account. Return to the CLI after you have completed this step.

Once logged in (or if you were already logged in), the CLI will prompt you to:
1. Select a **region** (e.g. `us-west-1`)
1. Enter a **project name**

After successful creation, you will see output similar to the following:

<details>

<summary>CLI output</summary>

```terminal
Let's set up your Prisma Postgres database!
? Select your region: ap-northeast-1 - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
? Enter a project name: testing-migration
✔ Success! Your Prisma Postgres database is ready ✅

We found an existing schema.prisma file in your current project directory.

--- Database URL ---

Connect Prisma ORM to your Prisma Postgres database with this URL:

prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=...

--- Next steps ---

Go to https://pris.ly/ppg-init for detailed instructions.

1. Install and use the Prisma Accelerate extension
Prisma Postgres requires the Prisma Accelerate extension for querying. If you haven't already installed it, install it in your project:
npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate

...and add it to your Prisma Client instance:
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate"

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

2. Apply migrations
Run the following command to create and apply a migration:
npx prisma migrate dev

3. Manage your data
View and edit your data locally by running this command:
npx prisma studio

...or online in Console:
https://console.prisma.io/{workspaceId}/{projectId}/studio

4. Send queries from your app
If you already have an existing app with Prisma ORM, you can now run it and it will send queries against your newly created Prisma Postgres instance.

Locate and copy the database URL provided in the CLI output. Then, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Now, paste the URL into it as a value for the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. For example:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=ey...
```

Run the following command to create tables in your database. This creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Execute the seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) to populate your database with some sample data, by running:

```terminal
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. Start the REST API server

```
npm run dev
```

The server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can send now the API requests, e.g. [`http://localhost:3000/users`](http://localhost:3000/users).

## Switch to another database

If you want to try this example with another database rather than Prisma Postgres, refer to the [Databases](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases) section in our documentation
