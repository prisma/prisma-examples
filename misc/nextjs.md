# 🚀 Fullstack Apps with Next.js and Prisma

Next.js blurs the lines between client and server. It supports pre-rendering pages at build time (SSG) or request time (SSR). **Prisma is the perfect companion if you need to work with a database in a Next.js app.**

Here is a list of example fullstack apps that are based on Next.js and use Prisma on the server to access data from a database. All examples are ready-to-run with a simple `yarn install` and `yarn dev`. They are based on SQLite, but thanks to Prisma you can easily connect your own PostgreSQL or MySQL database instead.
